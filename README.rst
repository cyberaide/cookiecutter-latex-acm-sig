cookiecutter-latex-acm-sig
==========================

Creates an ACM SiG template latex while using the tex and bib dir from cyberaide

You need to have cookiecutter installed, please do this with::

  pip install cookiecutter


To create a new directory with the template please do::

  cookiecutter https://github.com/cyberaide/cookiecutter-latex-acm-sig.git

YOu will find a new directory that includes the latex file and the
template file. I have not yet created posthoocs for checking out the
bib and tex dir from github and making soft links
